# Changelog

## 0.9.2 - Unreleased

### Fixed

- History: unwrap edited WhatsApp messages during history sync and backfill so stored/searchable text shows the edited body instead of `(message)`. (#246 - thanks @hiasinho)
- Sync: canonicalize `@lid` chat JIDs before enqueuing media downloads so `sync --follow --download-media` finds the correct DB row for live one-to-one messages. (#244 - thanks @Daniel1of1)

## 0.9.1 - 2026-05-15

### Added

- Calls: persist WhatsApp call signaling and call-log metadata, and add `wacli calls list`.

### Fixed

- Accounts: reject invalid account configs before saving and ignore relative `XDG_STATE_HOME` for default state paths.
- CLI: honor canceled store-lock waits before acquiring locks and stop reporting non-contention lock failures as ordinary contention.
- Media: fail before downloading when the output directory exists but is not writable.
- Media: sanitize `#`, control-wrapped blanks, and single-dot path components in generated media paths.
- Store: remove starred-message metadata when deleting chat-local data so cleanup cannot leave stale starred state behind.

## 0.9.0 - 2026-05-15

### Added

- Docker: add a local image with `/data` persistence, bundled `ffmpeg`, and Docker CI smoke coverage.
- Polls: add sending, voting, local result inspection, and sync persistence for WhatsApp polls. (#230 - thanks @Ortes)
- Send: add opt-in `send text --ephemeral` wrapping for disappearing-message chats. (#227 - thanks @AndroidPoet)

### Security

- Send: warm up recipients before send to reduce privacy-token failures. (#234 - thanks @AndroidPoet)

### Docs

## 0.8.1 - 2026-05-08

### Changed

- Module: migrate the canonical Go module/import path to `github.com/openclaw/wacli`. (#217 - thanks @dinakars777)

- Maintainers: remove the stale personal CODEOWNERS rule after the OpenClaw move. (#218 - thanks @dinakars777)
- Release: update GoReleaser archive config to the current v2 schema so release-config checks stay green.

### Fixed

- CLI: truncate table output by rune so emoji and other non-ASCII text stay valid UTF-8. (#222 - thanks @dinakars777)
- History: apply coverage/actionable filters before `LIMIT` so newer blocked chats do not hide ready chats. (#219 - thanks @dinakars777)
- Messages: extract display/search text from shared WhatsApp contact cards, including vCard phone numbers. (#214)
- Send: route whatsmeow diagnostics to stderr and clarify that `sent: true` means WhatsApp accepted the send request. (#215 - thanks @dinakars777)
- Sync: let explicit `--max-messages=0` override `WACLI_SYNC_MAX_MESSAGES`. (#220 - thanks @dinakars777)

## 0.8.0 - 2026-05-07

### Added
